Use the source bitmap intact. Do not synthesize, redraw, warp, relight, or replace any face or lettering inside the artwork.

Compose: build the rhetorical hook directly from a fire-streak entrance, locked bitmap reveal, and VO-paced live headline so the original artwork stays untouched.

Scene 1 (0.0–0.60s): ink-black full-bleed background; one fire-orange guitar-like light streak snaps upward with a basic transform as a deterministic ember burst crosses the upper half (`particle-burst`). Centered layered-depth composition with the frame still mostly dark; only the incoming sound hit and streak are visible.

Scene 2 (0.60–1.70s): the exact cover bitmap reveals at center through a fast transform push and resolves from a tight crop to a full square card via a smooth coordinate-target zoom (`coordinate-target-zoom`). As the voice reaches “เพลงร็อกในตำนาน,” the live Thai headline assembles chunk-by-chunk in the upper third (`dynamic-content-sequencing`), cream text with “ตำนาน” in fire-orange; centered hero, 3 depth layers, source faces untouched.

Scene 3 (1.70–2.194s): the question mark lands with one restrained basic scale settle; cover and headline hold completely still for the read while a bounded ember tail finishes. No exit animation; the harness transition owns the cut.

# Coordinate Target Zoom

A simple `scale > 1` on a wrapper pushes off-center content OFF the visible canvas. To zoom _into_ a specific non-centered element, apply scale AND an inverse translation in lockstep so the target lands at viewport center.

## How It Works

Two nested wrappers, separated concerns — never scale and translate on the SAME element (`translate * scale` ≠ `scale * translate` in CSS transform composition):

1. **Outer wrapper** applies `scale` (the zoom) around `transform-origin: 50% 50%`
2. **Inner wrapper** applies `translate(x, y)` (the counter-shift)

The counter-translate is the **negation** of the target's offset from viewport center:

```
T = -offset
```

Derivation: the inner translate moves the target to `offset + T` in pre-scale units; the outer scale S (around center) maps that to `S × (offset + T)`; landing at center means `S × (offset + T) = 0` → **`T = -offset`**. The formula does NOT depend on S — the translate is identical at 1.5×, 2×, or 3×. A common wrong intuition is `T = -offset × (S - 1)`: it coincidentally matches at S = 2 and is wrong at every other scale.

⚠️ **This is the NESTED-wrapper formula.** The single-wrapper camera in [viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md) puts `translate(x,y) scale(S)` on ONE element, where CSS applies scale first — there the counter-translate is **`T = -offset × S`**. The two formulas are not interchangeable; match the formula to the wrapper structure.

## Getting the offset

`T = -offset` is only as good as `offset`. The #1 way this pattern ships broken is hand-computing `offset` from a layout formula, getting the **sign** or magnitude wrong, and letting the zoom amplify a small error off-screen. **Default to measuring the target's real laid-out center; reserve the formula for symmetric rows.**

**Default — measure the actual center (works for ANY layout).** Immune to sign errors because it reads the rendered DOM, not a mental model:

```js
await document.fonts.ready; // metrics final; fallback fonts are 10–30px off → tens of px after a 3×+ zoom
const W = 1920,
  H = 1080;
const r = document.getElementById("target-card").getBoundingClientRect();
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = r.left + r.width / 2 - W / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_Y = r.top + r.height / 2 - H / 2;
```

Measure **once at setup** and bake — never per-frame in `onUpdate`. Because the measurement is async (`fonts.ready`), build and register the timeline inside the same `async` setup so the baked offset is ready before `window.__timelines[id]` is published.

**Shortcut — symmetric equal-width row ONLY:**

```js
const index_offset = targetIndex - (N - 1) / 2;
const TARGET_OFFSET_X = index_offset * (CARD_WIDTH + CARD_GAP);
```

⚠️ This assumes every sibling is the **same width**. The moment the row is asymmetric, it gives the wrong answer — often the wrong **sign**: the heavier side shifts the centered target the _opposite_ way you'd guess (e.g. `companion(220) + gap + wordmark + gap + chip(110)` puts the wordmark ~55px **right** of center, but "chip − companion" intuition says left). For anything but equal cards, **measure**.

**Headroom budget — cap the scale from the measured size.** A zoom multiplies any centering error; keep the target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak:

```js
const maxScale = Math.min((0.88 * W) / r.width, (0.88 * H) / r.height);
const ZOOM_SCALE = Math.min(DESIRED_SCALE, maxScale);
```

A target filling 97%+ of the frame reads as cut-off the instant its center is slightly off — and a hand-baked offset always is. (The perception gate flags this as `primary-offscreen`; `data-layout-allow-overflow` does **not** exempt it.)

## Recipe

```html
<div class="zoom-outer" id="zoom-outer">
  <div class="zoom-inner" id="zoom-inner">
    <div class="content">
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
      <div class="card target" id="target-card">{target}</div>
      <div class="card">{other}</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — at zoom > 1 the scaled content leaks past the frame */
}
.zoom-outer {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* center scaling is what the counter-translate math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
.zoom-inner {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
// TARGET_OFFSET_X/Y and ZOOM_SCALE come from "Getting the offset" — measured
// at setup (after fonts.ready), baked. Counter-translation = -offset.
const counterX = -TARGET_OFFSET_X;
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y;

// Scale and counter-translate MUST share position, duration, AND ease —
// otherwise the target visibly wanders mid-zoom.
tl.to("#zoom-outer", { scale: ZOOM_SCALE, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" }, ZOOM_AT);
tl.to(
  "#zoom-inner",
  { x: counterX, y: counterY, duration: ZOOM_DUR, ease: "power3.inOut" },
  ZOOM_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Zoom out (target → wide view)**: reverse the phases — start zoomed-in, then tween to `scale: 1` + `x: 0, y: 0`; the "reveal" beat is the panorama.
- **Multi-target zoom sequence**: chain zooms (target A → pause → target B → pull back); each segment needs its own counter-translation pair.

## Values

| token      | range                                   | notes                                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ZOOM_SCALE | 1.5× modest → 3× dominant → 5×+ extreme | cap via the headroom budget; raster media needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × ZOOM_SCALE` |
| ZOOM_DUR   | 1.0–2.0s                                | under 0.8s feels like a teleport, over 2.5s drags; both tweens share it                    |
| ZOOM_AT    | after the layout lands + 0.5–1.5s       | give the viewer time to scan the layout before the camera commits                          |
| DWELL      | ≥ 1.0s after the zoom settles           | 1.5–2s ideal — the viewer must be able to read the target (climax dwell)                   |

## Critical Constraints

- **Outer scales, inner translates** — never both transforms on one element; nested wrappers keep the math clean.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on the outer wrapper** — non-center origin breaks the counter-translate derivation.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the scene root** — zoomed content leaks past the frame otherwise.
- **Scale and counter-translate share duration + ease** at the same timeline position, or the target drifts mid-zoom.
- **Offset measured once at setup** (after `fonts.ready`), baked — never recomputed per-frame, never hand-derived for a non-symmetric layout (wrong sign → target shoved off-frame).
- **Scale within the headroom budget** — target ≤ ~88% of the canvas at peak, derived from the measured size.

## Selected motion rule: dynamic-content-sequencing

description: Auto-calculate timeline start/end times from content length + per-item duration config — longer content gets more screen time without hardcoded numbers.
metadata:
  tags: timeline, sequencing, dynamic, duration, content-aware, utility

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Values

| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BASE_DURATION | 0.6–1.5s              | minimum per entry regardless of length — even one-word entries get read time                                          |
| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |
| HOLD_MID      | 0.5–1.0s              | dwell on a non-final entry; `< HOLD_FINAL`                                                                            |
| HOLD_FINAL    | 1.0–2.0s              | climax dwell — must exceed HOLD_MID by a clear margin so the close reads as a beat                                    |
| SPEED_FACTOR  | 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0) | per-entry only; if every entry shares a factor, fold it into SEC_PER_CHAR                                             |
| TAIL_PAD      | 0.0–1.0s              | quiet beat after the last entry; prefer 0 when the next composition owns the breath                                   |
| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# Particle Burst

Discrete flying particles as a one-shot event: a **confetti pop** that erupts upward and drifts back down on gravity, a **dot burst** radiating from behind a landing word, or a **glyph dissolve** where text breaks into particles that scatter and die. Particles are ephemeral garnish — born from a beat, fly, gone; they never become layout.

Boundaries: [css-marker-patterns.md](css-marker-patterns.md)'s burst mode is radiating **drawn lines** — a static accent, no flight. [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md)'s release burst is **one blurred radial layer** faking an explosion — enough when a single glow pop will do. [center-outward-expansion.md](center-outward-expansion.md) moves **real layout elements** to final resting slots; particles have no destination, only physics and a death.

## How It Works

The whole event is **one driver tween and one formula**:

1. **Seeded setup** — a fixed pool of `PARTICLE_COUNT` small divs is created once at composition setup (a deterministic loop — setup-time generation is fine; per-frame DOM creation is not). Each particle `i` derives everything from a pure hash:

   ```js
   // angle, speed, size, spin, color (palette[i % palette.length]) — all from prand(i * k)
   const prand = (n) => {
     const x = Math.sin(n * 127.1 + 311.7) * 43758.5453;
     return x - Math.floor(x); // 0..1, pure function of n
   };
   ```

2. **Ballistic formula** — a proxy tween advances `T: 0 → 1` over `FLIGHT_DUR` with `ease: "none"`; `onUpdate` positions every particle as a **pure function of T**:

   ```
   x(T) = vx · T·FLIGHT_DUR
   y(T) = vy · T·FLIGHT_DUR + ½ · G · (T·FLIGHT_DUR)²
   rot(T) = spin · T·FLIGHT_DUR
   ```

   Gravity `G` supplies the rise-decelerate-fall arc for free. Because position is computed from `T` (never accumulated per frame), a seek to any moment renders the exact mid-flight state — this is what makes DOM particles seek-safe. The driver's `ease: "none"` is load-bearing: the physics lives in the formula; an eased driver warps gravity and the arc stops reading as thrown objects.

3. **Death** — an opacity tail inside the same formula (fade over the last `FADE_FRAC` of flight), or the confetti signature: a separate **instant-shrink** tween scaling the pool to 0 in a blink at flight end. Either way the particles end invisible and stay invisible.

## Recipe

  <div class="particle-field" id="particle-field"></div>

</div>
```

/* .burst-stage: position: relative; display: grid; place-items: center.

}
```

```js
// Setup: deterministic pool, generated ONCE.
const field = document.getElementById("particle-field");
const palette = ["{accentA}", "{accentB}", "{accentC}"]; // 3-5 brand tokens
const parts = [];
for (let i = 0; i < PARTICLE_COUNT; i++) {
  const el = document.createElement("div");
  el.className = "particle";
  const size = SIZE_MIN + prand(i * 3 + 1) * (SIZE_MAX - SIZE_MIN);
  el.style.width = `${size}px`;
  el.style.height = `${size * 0.7}px`; // slightly oblong = confetti chip
  el.style.background = palette[i % palette.length];
  field.appendChild(el);
  // Index-seeded launch parameters — the particle's whole life, fixed here.
  const angle = -Math.PI / 2 + (prand(i * 5 + 2) * 2 - 1) * CONE; // upward cone
  const speed = SPEED_MIN + prand(i * 7 + 3) * (SPEED_MAX - SPEED_MIN);
  parts.push({
    el,
    vx: Math.cos(angle) * speed,
    vy: Math.sin(angle) * speed, // negative = up
    spin: (prand(i * 11 + 4) * 2 - 1) * SPIN_MAX,
  });
}

// Confetti pop — one driver, pure ballistic formula.
const drive = { T: 0 };
tl.fromTo(
  drive,
  { T: 0 },
  {
    T: 1,
    duration: FLIGHT_DUR,
    ease: "none", // physics lives in the formula, not the ease
    onUpdate: () => {
      const t = drive.T * FLIGHT_DUR; // seconds of flight — pure function of T
      const fade = Math.min(1, (1 - drive.T) / FADE_FRAC); // opacity tail
      parts.forEach((p) => {
        const x = p.vx * t;
        const y = p.vy * t + 0.5 * G * t * t; // rise, stall, drift down
        p.el.style.transform = `translate(${x}px, ${y}px) rotate(${p.spin * t}deg)`;
        p.el.style.opacity = String(drive.T === 0 ? 0 : fade); // T===0 guard covers seeks before the event
      });
    },
  },
  BURST_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Confetti pop, then instant-shrink** — the playful signature: full burst, gravity drift, then every chip scales to 0 in a blink: `FADE_FRAC` near 0, plus `tl.to(".particle", { scale: 0, duration: SHRINK_DUR, ease: "power2.in" }, BURST_AT + FLIGHT_DUR - SHRINK_DUR)` with `SHRINK_DUR` 0.15–0.25s. Keep the whole event tiny relative to the subject — a garnish measured in a few dozen pixels, not a screen-filling cannon.
- **Dot burst behind a landing word** — radial instead of a cone: `angle = prand(i) * Math.PI * 2`, `G` near 0, short flight (0.4–0.7s), round dots (`border-radius: 50%`), pool z-indexed behind the word. Fire at the word's settle frame.
- **Glyph dissolve** — seed each particle's **origin** across the glyph block's box (`ox = (prand(i*13) - 0.5) * BLOCK_W`, same for `oy`, added inside the transform), gentle outward drift with low `G`; text fades out over the first ~30% of flight while particles fade in from its silhouette. Color every particle `{textColor}` so the swarm reads as the text's own material. (True per-pixel dissolves are Canvas-2D territory — `techniques.md`; this DOM version sells it up to ~40 particles.)
- **Two-stage burst (pop + stragglers)** — split the pool: 70% on the main driver, 30% on a second driver ~0.12s later with lower speeds; the split is index-derived (`i % 10 < 3`). Same formula, two windows.

## Critical Constraints

- **Position is a pure function of time, driver ease `"none"`** — `x(T)`, `y(T)`, `rot(T)` computed from the driver value every frame, never accumulated (`+=`) per tick (accumulation breaks the moment the renderer seeks); gravity is the ease — an eased driver bends the parabola.
- **Fixed pool, no per-frame DOM** — all particles exist after setup with `opacity: 0`; the event only writes `transform` / `opacity`. **`PARTICLE_COUNT ≤ ~40`** — per-frame style writes scale linearly; keep the event cheap.
- **Particles start AND end at `opacity: 0`** — the `drive.T === 0` guard covers seeks to before the event; the tail/shrink covers after. A chip frozen mid-air at driver end is a bug every subsequent frame.
- **Particles are punctuation** — one event per beat, fired on a cause, small relative to the subject, dead before the next beat; z-ordered behind or around the word it celebrates, never over it. A persistent particle system is a background, and that's not this rule.
