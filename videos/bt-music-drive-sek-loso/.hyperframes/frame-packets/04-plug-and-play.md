Construct the USB and icons deterministically with HTML/CSS/SVG. Use no third-party logo and no artist artwork in this frame.

Adapt: keep the blueprint’s three-item stagger assemble and resolved grid; place one USB hero above the three device icons. The icon row assembles on the spoken ease claim and then stops.

Scene 1 (0.0–0.61s): on an ink-black concert-stage plane, a black USB with restrained muted-gold trim rotates once from a three-quarter angle into a readable front angle using a bounded 3D transform (`depth-scatter-assemble`, single hero only), then settles above a sharp rectangular pedestal. Centered template, USB occupies at least 45% of the upper content area; a fire-orange spotlight blooms behind it (`ambient-glow-bloom`).

Scene 2 (0.61–1.46s): as the voice says “เสียบแล้วฟัง,” three sharp vector tiles assemble directly into a 3-column row—car, computer, speaker—via short-path stagger (`center-outward-expansion`); their internal line icons draw on (`svg-path-draw`). The live headline “เสียบแล้วฟังได้ทันที” reveals above the row on the phrase cue (`dynamic-content-sequencing`).

Scene 3 (1.46–2.038s): the device names “รถยนต์ • คอมพิวเตอร์ • ลำโพง” resolve under their icons; a small connector line from the USB to the icon row draws once (`svg-path-draw`). USB, headline, and icons hold still for legibility; only the already-running glow settles.

# Ambient Glow Bloom

A soft radial glow that **blooms in behind a hero element** (card, logo, metric) and holds, giving it presence. Unlike `press-release-spring`'s click-triggered burst or `asr-keyword-glow`'s word-timed envelope, this glow is **un-triggered** — it blooms on the hero's settle and stays lit. Two forms: a **hero bloom** that swells behind a settling element then breathes, and a **traveling sweep** that translates a soft highlight across a surface exactly once.

## How It Works

A radial-gradient layer sits **behind** the hero (glow `z-index: 1`, hero `z-index: 2` — a glow in front occludes it), starting at `opacity: 0`. Over the bloom-in window it ramps `opacity: 0 → peak` with a gentle `scale` swell, timed so `BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR` lands on the hero's settle — glow and hero resolve as ONE beat ("powering on"), never glow-then-card. After bloom-in:

1. **Hero bloom** — a **bounded idle breathe** during the hold: a finite `ease: "none"` tween advances a `phase` proxy and `onUpdate` nudges opacity + scale a hair around peak (never a `yoyo` loop). `sin(0) = 0` → the breathe starts exactly at the bloom's resting state.
2. **Traveling sweep** — a narrow highlight band at one edge translates **once** across to the other (`x` off-surface to off-surface), clipped to the surface (`overflow: hidden`). One pass, no return — a repeating sweep reads as a loading shimmer, not a reveal accent (the shimmer-sweep variation below is the sanctioned exception).

Peak opacity stays restrained (**≤ 0.45 hard ceiling**) so the glow gives presence without washing the frame; the glow color is **darker + more saturated** than the element it backs (a same-hue, same-lightness glow disappears into the surface).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<div class="bloom-stage">
  <div class="bloom-glow" id="bloom-glow"></div>
  <!-- z-index: 1; inset: GLOW_INSET (negative); background: {glowGradient} -->
  <div class="hero-card" id="hero-card">{HeroLabel}</div>
  <!-- z-index: 2 -->
</div>
<!-- sweep form: <div class="sweep" id="sweep"> inside the overflow:hidden surface -->
```

```js
// ── Form A: HERO BLOOM ── bloom in soft, landing on the hero's settle.
tl.fromTo(
  "#bloom-glow",
  { opacity: 0, scale: GLOW_START_SCALE },
  { opacity: GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY, scale: 1, duration: BLOOM_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  BLOOM_START,
);
// Bounded breathe during the hold — finite phase tween, NOT a yoyo loop.
const glow = document.getElementById("bloom-glow");
const phase = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  phase,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BREATHE_CYCLES,
    duration: BREATHE_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = Math.sin(phase.p);
      glow.style.opacity = String(GLOW_PEAK_OPACITY + s * OPACITY_AMP);
      glow.style.transform = `scale(${1 + s * SCALE_AMP})`;
    },
  },
  BLOOM_START + BLOOM_DUR,
);

// ── Form B: TRAVELING SWEEP ── one finite pass, constant glide.
tl.fromTo(
  "#sweep",
  { x: SWEEP_START_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: SWEEP_END_X, opacity: SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY, duration: SWEEP_DUR, ease: "none" },
  SWEEP_START,
);
tl.to("#sweep", { opacity: 0, duration: SWEEP_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.in" }, SWEEP_FADE_START);
```

## Variations

- **Bloom-and-hold** — for scenes <3s or a hero with its own idle, skip the breathe: the single `fromTo` is the whole recipe.
- **Pulse-on-arrival** — bloom slightly PAST peak (`GLOW_OVERSHOOT_OPACITY`, `scale: 1.06`), then a second adjacent tween eases down to a steady hold — one breath punctuating the landing, no ongoing loop.
- **Multi-hero relay** — stagger per-glow `BLOOM_START` by ~0.15–0.3s across a row; shrink `OPACITY_AMP` / `SCALE_AMP` per the `/√N` rule below.
- **Diagonal raked sweep** — angle `{sweepGradient}` (~105°) across a wordmark: the classic one-pass logo sheen. Narrower `SWEEP_WIDTH`, higher `SWEEP_PEAK_OPACITY`.

### Shimmer sweep (text-clipped status-phrase working-state)

The sweep re-aimed **inside type**: a soft highlight gradient clipped into a status phrase ("Thinking…", "Analyzing dataset…") via `background-clip: text` travels left→right through the letterforms — the grey-on-grey shimmer that says _still working_. Unlike every other form here it legitimately **repeats while the status is live**: the repetition is diegetic working-state, not idle wobble (same defense as a blinking caret — the motion performs status). Two things keep it honest: it is **bounded** (one finite tween whose pass count is computed from the status window, never `repeat: -1`), and it is **killed at resolve** — the moment the status completes, the shimmer stops dead; a shimmer surviving into the answer beat turns a working indicator into decoration.

```js
// Status shimmer — N passes as ONE bounded tween. Killed at resolve.
const status = document.getElementById("status-phrase");
// CSS on #status-phrase: background: {shimmerGradient}; background-size: 300% 100%;
// -webkit-background-clip: text; background-clip: text; color: transparent;
const shimmer = { p: 0 };
const PASSES = Math.round(STATUS_DUR / PASS_PERIOD); // whole passes, computed up front
tl.to(
  shimmer,
  {
    p: PASSES,
    duration: STATUS_DUR,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const t = shimmer.p % 1; // 0→1 within each pass; percent axis inverted → left→right travel
      status.style.backgroundPosition = `${(1 - t) * 100}% 50%`;
    },
  },
  STATUS_START,
);
tl.set(status, { backgroundPosition: "100% 50%" }, STATUS_START + STATUS_DUR); // resolve: dead.
```

Keep it a whisper: `{shimmerGradient}` is the status text's own grey with one slightly-lighter band (highlight stop a step above the base, nothing near white); `background-size` ~300% keeps the band narrow in the glyphs; `PASS_PERIOD` 1.2–1.8s — slower reads as a sheen accent, faster as a spinner. Whole-number `PASSES` lands the band at its start position exactly at the kill frame, so the `tl.set` is visually a no-op. This is the working-state cousin of `gradient-text-sweep`: reach **here** when the sweep _means_ "in progress," **there** when the gradient is the typographic treatment itself.

## Critical Constraints

- **Glow peak opacity ≤ 0.45** — including breathe amplitude; default to the LOW end (0.15–0.30).
- **Glow behind, hero in front**; glow color darker + more saturated than the hero surface.
- **Land glow and hero as one beat** — before or after reads as two separate events.
- **Breathe is bounded, sweep is one pass** — the only sanctioned repetition is the shimmer sweep, bounded and killed at resolve.
- **Concurrent halos compound** — per-glow amps ≤ default `/√N`, stagger breathe periods (2.6s / 2.9s / 3.3s) so they don't pulse in lockstep.
- **Don't combine a `boxShadow` glow on the hero with this halo layer** — they compete and read muddy; the glow lives on the dedicated layer.

# Center-Outward Expansion

Elements begin at one shared center point and radiate outward to their final positions — the entry beat itself, or motion driven by another animation's progress (a counting number, a beat). Flat 2D cousin of [depth-scatter-assemble.md](depth-scatter-assemble.md) (per-element 3D cloud): here every element shares the SAME origin.

## How It Works

Each element carries its final offset as `data-target-x/y`. Its position lerps between center and target: `x = targetX × progress`. Self-centering is baked as `xPercent/yPercent: -50` so the tweened `x`/`y` are pure offsets from the stage center. Standalone burst = per-item staggered `fromTo`; driven burst = one shared proxy (see Variations).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-wrap">
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="-360" data-target-y="-180">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="360" data-target-y="-180">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="0" data-target-y="360">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.burst-wrap {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.burst-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%; /* GSAP xPercent/yPercent -50 bakes the centering; x/y tween the offset */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".burst-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, x: 0, y: 0, scale: 0.6, opacity: 0 },
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      scale: 1,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: EXPAND_DUR,
      ease: EXPAND_EASE,
    },
    ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Synced to a driver (chord)**: when the burst shadows a counter / beat, drop the stagger and drive all items from ONE 0→1 proxy tween with the driver's exact duration AND ease; `onUpdate` writes `translate(-50%,-50%) translate(targetX*p, targetY*p)` per item — the two read as one beat.
- **Partially-spread start**: with 6+ items the full cluster piles up — start from `{ x: targetX * START_PROGRESS, ... }`.
- **Idle micro-float**: hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) after landing instead of freezing.

| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ITEM_COUNT     | 3–8                  | > 8 = visual chaos mid-expansion; low counts want wider spread   |
| EXPAND_DUR     | 1.0–1.8s             | must equal the driver's duration in the synced variant           |
| EXPAND_EASE    | `power3.out` default | `power2.out` gentler, `expo.out` dramatic stop; NEVER `in` eases |
| STAGGER        | 0.04–0.08s           | tighter = chord; looser = lazy arpeggio                          |
| ENTRY_AT       | 0–0.5s               | a beat of compositional quiet before the burst                   |
| START_PROGRESS | 0–0.5                | 0 = dramatic full cluster; ~0.3 avoids the pile-up               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween `x`/`y` over the baked `xPercent/yPercent: -50`** — mutating `left`/`top` fights the centering and causes pixel jitter.
- **Out-easing only** — `in` easings read as items being sucked back mid-air.
- **No other absolute-positioned siblings inside `.burst-wrap`** — they'd steal the centered baseline.
- **❗ The burst IS the beat** — don't park a "real headline" label below it (the eye snaps to the label and ignores the burst). If a label is needed, reveal it post-burst in the same stack.
- Synced variant: identical duration + ease as the driver, or the chord falls apart.

## Selected motion rule: depth-scatter-assemble

name: depth-scatter-assemble
description: N elements scatter into / reassemble from a rotating 3D depth-cloud, each starting at a deterministic index-derived 3D offset and settling to a clean flat layout.

# Depth Scatter ↔ Assemble

N elements (glyphs, cards, logo fragments) fly in from a rotating 3D depth-cloud and lock into a flat layout — or the reverse. Each element has its OWN index-derived point in the cloud (translateZ depth + rotateX/Y tumble + x/y scatter). Distinct from `orbit-3d-entry` (flip-in then continuous orbit) and `center-outward-expansion` (flat burst from one shared center): here the resolve is a flat assembled layout.

## How It Works

Each element's flat target lives in `data-target-x/y`; its scattered state is pure trig on its index — golden-angle spread, stepped depth — so the cloud is byte-identical every render with no `Math.random`:

```js
const GOLDEN = Math.PI * (3 - Math.sqrt(5)); // ~2.39943 rad — even spread, no clumping
const a = i * GOLDEN;
const scatterX = Math.cos(a) * RADIUS;
const scatterY = Math.sin(a) * RADIUS;
const scatterZ = Z_NEAR - (i / (n - 1)) * (Z_NEAR - Z_FAR); // stepped depth
const rotX = Math.sin(a) * TUMBLE;
const rotY = Math.cos(a) * TUMBLE;
```

Elements are PARKED at their scatter points (`gsap.set`, opacity 0) before any tween, then each tweens to its flat target while the whole stage slowly rotates so the scatter has life before it locks. Requires `perspective` on the scene root and `preserve-3d` on the stage AND each element, or depth + tumble flatten to a 2D scale.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="cloud-stage">
  <div class="frag" data-target-x="-260" data-target-y="0">{glyph1}</div>

```

}
.cloud-stage {

  will-change: transform, opacity;
}
```

```js
const frags = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".frag"));
const n = frags.length;
const GOLDEN = Math.PI * (3 - Math.sqrt(5));

// 1) Park every fragment in the cloud BEFORE any tween fires
const scatter = frags.map((el, i) => {
  const a = i * GOLDEN;
  const depthT = n > 1 ? i / (n - 1) : 0;
  return {
    x: Math.cos(a) * RADIUS,
    y: Math.sin(a) * RADIUS,
    z: Z_NEAR - depthT * (Z_NEAR - Z_FAR),
    rotationX: Math.sin(a) * TUMBLE,
    rotationY: Math.cos(a) * TUMBLE,
  };
});
frags.forEach((el, i) => gsap.set(el, { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, ...scatter[i], opacity: 0 }));

// 2) The cloud rotates so the scatter has life during assembly
tl.to(
  ".cloud-stage",
  { rotationY: CLOUD_SPIN_DEG, duration: CLOUD_SPIN_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  0,
);

// 3) ASSEMBLE — cloud point → flat target, index stagger = cloud collapsing inward
frags.forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.to(
    el,
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      z: 0,
      rotationX: 0,
      rotationY: 0,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: ASSEMBLE_DUR,
      ease: ASSEMBLE_EASE,
    },
    i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Tumble-swap** (the beat-change hand-off): two glyph sets share the cloud; ONE shared 0→1 progress tween drives both in its `onUpdate` — outgoing lerps layout→cloud with `opacity: 1−p`, incoming lerps cloud→layout with `opacity: p`. Two separate tweens drift out of phase under seek and the cross stops reading as one hand-off. Inject per-glyph spans per phrase at setup (measure advance widths after `document.fonts.ready` — single-scene only).
- **Radial letter-explode → resolve**: flat-plane special case — `Z_NEAR = Z_FAR = 0`, small `TUMBLE`; reverse the assemble for the explode. Pure in-plane.
- **Scatter-OUT**: reverse assemble (layout → cloud, opacity 1→0) ONLY as the composition's final beat — mid-shot it reads as the shot ending.
- **Parallax lockup**: back layers get deeper `|Z_FAR|` + longer `ASSEMBLE_DUR`, foreground shallower/shorter — depth-speeded slide-in that locks into the logo.

## Critical Constraints

- **Every scattered value is index-derived** — `cos/sin(i × GOLDEN)` + stepped `z`. The golden angle spreads points evenly with no clumps and no `Math.random`.
- **`gsap.set` the cloud BEFORE adding tweens** — skipping it leaves frame 0 showing the assembled layout, then a teleport when the first tween starts.
- **`perspective` + `preserve-3d` on stage AND each fragment** — missing any one flattens the depth.
- **Resolve flat** — settled state is `z: 0`, rotations 0; a still-tilted resolve reads unfinished.
- **Tumble-swap: one shared progress for both glyph sets.**
- **Depth ordering is automatic** inside `preserve-3d` (paint order follows actual Z) — no manual z-index, unlike the orbit case's capped band.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
